        <h1>Playing A Concert</h1>
        <p class="top-tip">If you hit a wrong note or make a mistake, dont stop playing - just keep going and look as though you ment it</p>
        <p>Playing a concert can be great fun! Or it can be totally scary! Sometimes both at the same time.</p>
        <p>So we've put together a list of out top tips for great concerts.</p>
        <h2>Write out a set-list</h2>
        <p>A <strong>set-list</strong> is a list of all your song in the order you'll play them.</p>
        <p>print it <strong>Big!</strong> so that you can still read it if it's down by your feet on the floor or if the lighting isn't very good.</p>
        <h2>Remember your spares</h2>
        <p>Some instruments have parts that neeed to be replaced if they wear out or break. For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Guitar Strings</li>
            <li>Saxaphone or Clarenet reeds</li>
            <li>Drumsticks</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Make a list of spares you might need and make sure you know where they are in an emergency.</p>
        <h2>Plan where you'll be on the stage</h2>
        <p>Before you start to set up your instruments, take a few minutes to decide where you're all going to be.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Will the drums be center stage? Or off to one side?</li>
            <li>Is there a power socket for the amplifier if your guitar player stands to the right?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>It's much better to think about <strong>before</strong> you start setting up your instruments. Its really annoying if you have to start unplugging things and swaping places once you've begun to set thing up!</p>
        <h2>Know where you're going , know when you're on</h2>
        <p>If you're playing a concert somewhere you've never been before make sure you know where it is. Print out a map or set the GPS before you leave. There's nothing worse than being lost in an unfamiliar place a half hour before you're due to go onstage.</p>
        <p>And when you do arrive, the first thing you should do is <strong>find out what time you're on on.</strong> Times often change. Ask whoever is running the event when you'll be on. Dont get caught off guard!</p>
